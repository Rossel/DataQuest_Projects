# DataQuest Project Solutions

This repository is a series of notebooks I made while working on real-life projects on [DataQuest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/data-science-bootcamp/). DataQuest offers online, project-based data science courses focused on data analysis using Python and R. I chose for DataQuest to get learn data science, because of its unique, hands-on approach using interactive coding challenges and projects. 

DataQuest does not provide theoretical concepts in the form of videos and, but instead challenges the user to apply the coding and data analysis techniques in short intervals. It also utilizes real-world data and has a project-based approach, which provides a good representation of what a data scientist works with day-to-day.

It is an exciting learning journey on my way to become skilled in the data science field.
