# DataQuest Guided Project Solutions

This repository is a series of notebooks that I made to solve the guided projects on [DataQuest.io](www.dataquest.io). In order to solve these projects, I have used all the available material and the hands-on experience I gained during the projects. 

DataQuest offers online, project-based data science courses focused on data analysis using Python and R. I chose for DataQuest to learn data science, because of its unique, hands-on approach in teaching data science using interactive coding challenges and projects. 

DataQuest is not like typical MOOCs where everything is spoon fed and most material consists of videos. Here you are actually challenged to apply the coding and data analysis techniques every 5 minutes. It offers with real-world data and has a project-based approach, which provides a good representation of what a data scientist might work with day-to-day.

It is an exciting learning journey on my way to become a skilled professional in the data science field.
