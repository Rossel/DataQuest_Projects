# DataQuest Guided Project Solutions

This repository is a series of notebooks I made while working on real-life projects on [DataQuest.io](http://www.dataquest.io). DataQuest offers online, project-based data science courses focused on data analysis using Python and R. I chose for DataQuest to acquire data science knowledge, because of its unique, hands-on approach using interactive coding challenges and projects. 

DataQuest is not like typical MOOCs where theoretical concepts and a lot of the material just consists of videos. It challenges the user to apply the coding and data analysis techniques every 5 minutes. It utilizes real-world data and has a project-based approach, which provides a good representation of what a data scientist could work with day-to-day.

It is an exciting learning journey on my way to become skilled in the data science field.
